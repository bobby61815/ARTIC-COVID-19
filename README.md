# Introduction
The ARTIC network is developed to process samples from viral outbreaks and to understand fast evolving RNA viruses. This is also based on single-molecule portable sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore Technology MinION. we are creating a ‘lab-in-a-suitcase’ that can be deployed to remote and resource-limited locations.
