# Introduction
The ARTIC network is developed to process samples from viral outbreaks and understand fast-evolving RNA viruses. This is based on a single-molecule portable sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore Technology MinION. Because of that, it can be deployed to remote and resource-limited locations. Researchers in Brazil also used this ARTIC network to analyze the first COVID-19 case in Brazil.

# Methodology
This approach used primers to amplify different region from the virus genome in order to improve the sensitivty. They kept updating the primer version from version 1 to version 4 in order to improves the performance in some regions that are hard to amplify. Here, I used the v3 primer scheme and assembled all the amplicons together to get consensus sequence. Based on that, I can compare the sequence to the original virus (Wuhan-Hu-1).(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)
